Connect frontend and backend: API calls from your frontend to your backend.
Setting up fetch or axios calls in your frontend to the routes you've defined in your backend.

Implement CRUD operations: Create (post), read (get), update (put), and delete (delete) operations are the backbone of most web applications. 
Both in backend (as Express routes that interact with your MongoDB database) and frontend (as API calls to these routes).

Unit tests for backend, integration tests for API, and end-to-end tests for frontend.
