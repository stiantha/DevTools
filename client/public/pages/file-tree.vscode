# [file-tree-generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MutableUniverse.vscode-file-tree-generator)

Designed to streamline the process of generating a tree-like structure of files and directories within your workspace.
Effortlessly visualize the hierarchy of your project's files and output it to a separate file for reference or documentation purposes.

### Key Features

- **File Tree Generation**: Easily generate a hierarchical representation of your file system starting from a specified directory within your workspace.

- **File Content Inclusion**: Optionally include the content of the files in the generated tree, providing a comprehensive overview of your project's structure and contents.

- **Ignoring Files**: Customize the file tree generation process by ignoring specific files and directories.
You can define exclusion patterns using rules specified in the `.gitignore` file or manually set them in settings.

- **Output to File**: The generated file tree is conveniently saved to a file named `generated-tree.txt`, 
allowing for easy access and sharing with team members or for documentation purposes.
