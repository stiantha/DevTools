# Prettier - Code formatter

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports multiple languages and integrates with most editors. The key philosophy of Prettier is to take away the decision-making of code formatting, so you can focus on code writing.

### Features

- Supports many languages
- Integrates with most editors
- Has few options

### Installation

You can install Prettier in Visual Studio Code by navigating to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), searching for "Prettier - Code formatter", and clicking on Install.

### Usage

Once installed, you can use Prettier by:

1. Opening a file you want to format
2. Pressing Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette
3. Typing "Format Document" and pressing Enter

You can also configure Prettier to format your files automatically on save by adding the following to your settings.json file:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```
Configuration
Prettier can be configured in your project using a .prettierrc file. Here's an example configuration:
```json
{
  "semi": false,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```
